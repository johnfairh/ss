///
/// Sass models strings as a sequence of unicode scalars, not Swift's primary view as a sequence
/// of extended grapheme clusters.  So any string index you receive through Sass applies to the unicode
/// scalar view of the string.
///
/// Further, Sass models 1 as the first element and `count` as the last.  This class offers
/// a `sassIndexToSwiftIndex(...)`  method to wrap up both parts of this conversion, but offers
/// only sympathy to users having to deal with the results.
