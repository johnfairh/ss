import Foundation

/// Methods required to implement a stylesheet importer.
///
/// This type resolves `@import`, `@use`, and `@forward` rules in
/// stylesheets.  The methods are called back by the compiler during compilation.  You
/// don't need this to include the contents of a filesystem directory: see instead
/// `ImportResolver.loadPath()`.
///
/// You could use this to present network resources or dynamically constructed content.
///
/// An import has two steps: canonicalization and loading.
///
/// `Importer.canonicalize(...)` is always called first with whatever URL
/// text the user has written in their rule.  The routine interprets that and returns a _canonical_
/// URL that is absolute with a scheme.
///
/// The compiler most likely implements a cache based on canonical URLs.  If the compiler
/// does not have a stylesheet cached for the canonical URL then it calls
/// `Importer.load(...)` with that URL to get at the content.
///
/// ### File extension rules
///
/// Sass itself handles imports from the filesystem using various filename conventions.
/// Users of your importer mostly likely expect the same behavior if the URLs you
/// are importing resemble filenames with extensions and directories.
///
/// From the embedded Sass protocol documentation:
///
/// * The importer should look for stylesheets by adding the prefix `_` to the
///   URL's basename, and by adding the extensions `.sass` and `.scss` if the
///   URL doesn't already have one of those extensions. For example, given the URL
///   "foo/bar/baz" the importer should look for:
///
///   * `foo/bar/baz.sass`
///   * `foo/bar/baz.scss`
///   * `foo/bar/_baz.sass`
///   * `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
///
///   Given the URL "foo/bar/baz.scss" the importer should look for:
///
///   * `foo/bar/baz.scss`
///   * `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
///
///   If the importer finds a stylesheet at more than one of these URLs then it
///   must throw an error indicating that the import is ambiguous.
///
/// * If none of the possible paths are valid then the importer should perform the
///   same resolution on the URL followed by `/index`. In the example above, it
///   should additionally look for:
///
///   * `foo/bar/baz/_index.sass`
///   * `foo/bar/baz/index.sass`
///   * `foo/bar/baz/_index.scss`
///   * `foo/bar/baz/index.scss`
///
///   If more than one of these implicit index resources exist then the importer must
///   throw an error indicating that the import is ambiguous.

    /// - throws: Only when `importString` cannot be canonicalized: it is definitely
    ///   this importer's responsibility to do so, but it can't.

    ///   anything then the importer should return `nil` instead.
