/// The Swift type of a Sass function.
///
/// Use this to define Sass functions written in Swift that are available to stylesheets as they
/// are compiled.
///
/// `SassValue` is used to transmit function parameters and return values: any parameters with
/// default values are instantiated before the function is called.  All `SassValue`s are immutable.
///
/// Usually the first job of a function is to downcast each parameter to the expected type.  You can
/// convert directly to Swift native types using initializers like `String(_:)`,  but this loses any
/// additional metadata such as units and list punctuation that is tracked by the Sass type: if you need
/// this metadata then downcast to the specific Sass type using methods like `SassValue.asString(...)`.
///
/// Any error thrown from the function ends up cancelling the compilation job and returning an
/// error message back to the user that contains the text of the error thrown.
///
/// All Sass functions return a value -- there is no `void` return type.  Create new `SassValue`
/// objects using a subclass initializer such as `SassString(_:isQuoted:)`.
///
